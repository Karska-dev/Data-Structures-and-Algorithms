/* This weekâ€™s question:
Your music library contains N songs and your friend wants to listen to L songs during your road trip (repeats are allowed). Make a playlist so that every song is played at least once, and a song can only be played again only if K other songs have been played. Return the number of possible playlists.

Examples:

$ numPlaylists(N = 3, L = 3, K = 1)
$ 6 // [1, 2, 3], [1, 3, 2], [2, 1, 3], [2, 3, 1], [3, 1, 2], [3, 2, 1]  */
